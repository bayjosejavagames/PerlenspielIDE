In this game, the player controlls a father figure in a factory, sorting boxes into directories. The directories are not updated in real time, so the player needs to keep a mental note of the state of everything, and prepare for the future. Once all the boxes are sorted, the player then takes controll of a child figure, who then needs to move the boxes, as the father figure moves the crates around in real time.
