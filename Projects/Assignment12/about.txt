The experience goal of this game is for the player to complete the puzzle sequence in the fewest number of moves and to play the game for longer than two minutes. When the game starts the player is presented with a set of tiles on the screen. This set of beads has a blinking white bead in the center. This is the tutorial phase, if the player has already completed the tutorial they can simply hold the white square down for two seconds and the game will start. The tutorial phase teaches the player how tiles overlapping interact with one another. 
When the player clicks on a tile, a 3x3 grid around the bead clicked is toggled to the opposite state. The player has a calculated number of moves to get the board back to a solved state. When this solved state is reached, the difficulty increases and more 
toggled beads are added to the level. All levels can be solved. When a player fails a level, the level is solved for the player, then a new level of the same difficulty is generated.
